When the CTO called up my name, I was like why she is calling me!. She comes near me to hand an envelope, strangely I had no expression and continued with the knowledge transfer session.

Back in the apartment, after an hour, I contemplated the amount required for college fee payments, money owed to mates, and repaying a fraction to credit cards. It piled up in the time from graduation till OPT got approved (It would be a good story to share some other time).

Gee, I had pennies by evening in the bank ðŸ˜¥.
