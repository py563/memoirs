Before delving into the topic, I would like to appreciate all the helpful personnel, donors, and volunteers across India. I respect and bow to all of these amazing people across the world.

With the migrant crisis, the nation is facing this pandemic and other policies we went through as a nation. This post tries to address only the fascination we hold about the American governance system as the best in the world and I was once among these people. But now after spending the last decade in one of the metropolitan cities on the US east coast, I phantom imagination of the American system is the best. It is as broken, as doomed, or more than India's political and democratic system.

A small example from last week to demonstrate the broken system, thousands of tons of potatoes were left out by farmers in Idaho. Yet, people in other states hold mile-long parking for four-way cars near food banks. With the fear of meat shortages, factories had to run even with less PPE for the workers. Few had to die to get better protection or for the factories to be shut down.

Few of the administrative tasks and policies that come from the federal democracy model in the USA are praiseworthy and robust. This was perfectly argued by [Jayaprakash Narayan](https://www.facebook.com/JPLOKSATTA/) Garu, that India as a nation should move to that model. The federal government should be responsible for more quintessential core services, and there should be harmony between national and state governments.

The United States of America is the richest country and the ultimate superpower. In the last two decades, If not for China, there would not have been competition to the America. With the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been revealed to the world that the borderline between the rich and poor (including the middle class) is exponentially increasing in the USA. With the average debt per person at its peak and a month of lockdown in the world's richest nation made millions penny less and folk around the food banks.

Unlike Indians, they do not know the concept of or have a proper structure for savings and are surviving paycheck to paycheck. The art of saving comes through either the culture or the family first tenet to Asians. The American system was robust and has been one of the best for the last two centuries and made what the United States is today. But it has been failing for the last decade, people over there need to learn and change it for the better. A decade ago everyone would have dismissed the thought that when a pandemic rages across the world, a state in America would host more victims than the whole of India, let alone the United States hosting more than half of the victims and deaths (projection) across the world.
