It's important to consider the consequences of occupying (legally and illegally) rivers and nalas without updating the drainage system that was designed in the 1930s. The recent disasters that have affected many areas of Hyderabad are partly a result of our own negligence. The authorities responsible for maintaining the drainage system, such as GHMC and HMDA officials, have been neglecting this issue for far too long. It's time for them to take action and address this problem before it's too late.
