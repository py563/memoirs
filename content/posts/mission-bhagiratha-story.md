A few days back, I browsed the [UnitedCSE](https://unitedcse.blogspot.com/) blog (Bachelors Class of 2011 blog in BITS Warangal). While going through it, I came across two posts that caught my attention - one of the posts was composed by me, and the other by Almeen. This prompted me to message Almeen on Facebook, even though he had not been active on the platform for a while.

However, I found that Facebook had become quite heavy and commercialized, with advertisements and videos dominating the news feed instead of updates from friends. As time passed by, I was working hard to make a USB bootable for a friend using UNetBootin. The fan was fuming out heat and reminded me of the Vizag steel plant blast furnace that I had visited back in 2004. Although it might seem strange, I still remember that trip vividly.

As I continued to work, I started searching for a supermarket store where I had worked for a few days in Bangalore back in 2011 or 2012. I couldn't remember the name of the store, but I did remember the block where it was located in JP Nagar. However, I wasn't able to find any information about the store on maps. Despite this, I found some old project files and memories from BITS that I had been searching for a long time.

My nostalgia-induced search continued until 6 AM, even as I tried to log in to the UnitedCSE blog using the blog's login email address, which I had obtained through a data mining project on my Gmail inbox.
