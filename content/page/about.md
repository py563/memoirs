A little back story, in case you are new here.

I graduated from the Kennedy School of Sciences at University of Massachusetts, Lowell in May 2015 with Masters Degree in Computer Science. I completed my bachelors at Balaji Institute of Technology and Sciences, Warangal in April 2011.

I co-founded Yayin AI Lab and run the A Washed-up Nerd store where in we design and sell mechanical keyboards for English and Indic Langauges soon.

I had the joy to work as a Cyber Security Research Engineer at Philips, Software Engineer at Symbiosys, and at Tech Mahindra.

I also teach undergrad programming courses.

I relish traveling, widely follow Cricket, F1, and major sports teams based within Boston and Hyderabad.

I am politically not inclined to either right or left, but i believe in good governence, responsible leader, voters and citizens. I care about climate change we need to reduce our plastic usage.
